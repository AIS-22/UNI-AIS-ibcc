    "## Classical Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "For the *Imaging Beyond Consumer Cameras PS* we had to come up with two different approaches to 3D reconstruct an object of a single image.\n",
    "First we implemented a classic approach using just vanishing lines and vanishing points to reconstruct the image.\n",
    "* **Vanishing-Points:** Are points where the extended edge lines of an objectÂ´s dimension intersect.\n",
    "* **Vanishing_Lines:** Are lines which connect vanishing points of all 3 dimensions.\n",
    "This information can be used to extract information about the alignment (translation and rotation) of the given object in the image.\n",
    "This chapter explains how we developed our classic 3D reconstruction pipeline from camera calibration to the 3D object shown with Blender.\n",
    "\n",
    "Later in this report also the second approach using a neural network gets explained.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Camera Calibration (done by Michael Hafner)\n",
    "Since a camera ex- and intrinsics distort the image, in this project camera calibration was needed to remove those distortions.\n",
    "The  used code for camera calibration got adapted directly from *OpenCV*. To determine the parameters of the camera the following steps are necessary:\n",
    "1. Generate a checkerboard patter by using the *gen_pattern.py* file, provided in the Calibration folder.\n",
    "    * *python gen_pattern.py -o chessboard.svg --rows 10 --columns 7 --type checkerboard --square_size 20*\n",
    "    The amount of rows and columns declares the number of checker (white and black). The svg file than gets stored to the under *-o* declared path.\n",
    "2. Print out the checkerboard pattern and stick it to a plain and stiff surface. Otherwise, possible curvatures distort the determined parameters of the algorithm.\n",
    "3. Place the camera on its position where also the object gets photographed and take multiple images (angles) of the checkerboard. The more images, the more precise the results will become.\n",
    "4. After that, execute the notebook *CamCalibration.ipynb*\n",
    "    * The algorithm behind detects the edges where the black checker 'touch' each other.\n",
    "    * With that and the information of the size of the checker in the real world it is possible to map the 3D real world checker in the 2D image plane and determine the camera parameters from the known dimensions of the calibration pattern.\n",
    "5. This parameter then get stored in a numpy object/file to can be later used to undistort the image."
